# PROC-05 Procurement Planning

**Status:** Draft for business review · **Version:** 0.1 · **Hierarchy:** Procurement → Procurement Planning → Annual and Period Procurement Plan → Operations · **Framework:** [ERP 28-section standard](../hrm/feature-specifications/ERP_Feature_Specification_Framework_Enterprise_Integration_Updated.docx) · **Module:** [PROC-00](PROC-00-PROCUREMENT-MODULE-ARCHITECTURE-AND-CAPABILITY-MAP.md)

## 1. Feature Identification

`PROC-05`, advanced phase. Business owner: Procurement planning lead; Finance funding owner; product/data/technical owners to name. Operations: `O1` create plan, `O2` consolidate/review, `O3` approve/activate, `O4` revise, `O5` link PR/track utilization, `O6` close period.

## 2. Purpose and Business Outcome

Departments forecast purchases so Procurement can schedule sourcing and Finance can see expected demand. A plan is a forecast and governance record, not an automatic budget reservation or permission to issue a PO.

## 3. Scope and Exclusions

Includes financial-year/period plans, departmental requirements, expected amount/date/method/funding source, review, revision, PR linkage and utilization. Finance owns budgets and project funding. Demand prediction, automated supplier sourcing and capital authorization are separate.

## 4. Parent and Related Features

Parent Procurement Planning; uses organization/cost-centre/project refs, Finance budget periods, PROC-04 catalog/category and PROC-02 PR. Sourcing uses approved future demand; reports compare plan and actual.

## 5. Actors and Participants

Department planner, department head, Procurement planning reviewer, Finance budget owner, project owner, requester, auditor and scheduled reminder service.

## 6. Entry Points and Triggers

Annual planning window, new entity/project, budget cycle, approved plan change, PR referencing a plan line, period-end review or contract expiry forecast.

## 7. Preconditions

Valid entity, financial period, department, funding reference, currency and plan policy; planner has scope. Finance budget existence is checked separately and never inferred from plan approval.

## 8. Workflow

`O1`: department drafts requirements with quantity, category, date, estimate, method and source. `O2`: Procurement consolidates similar demand, returns gaps and records Finance funding review. `O3`: assigned approvers activate version. `O4`: material change creates revision with delta and reapproval. `O5`: PR links exact plan line/version and actual order/receipt progress derives utilization. `O6`: owner closes period and carries forward only through a new plan/version.

## 9. Status and State Transitions

Draft → Submitted → Reviewed → Approved → Active → Revised → Closed; Returned/Rejected/Cancelled as alternate paths. Actor, evidence, version, effective period, SLA and escalation are explicit. Revised plan preserves original; period close does not cancel existing PRs.

## 10. Permissions and Data Scope

`procurement.plan.edit` for assigned department, `.review` for Procurement, `.approve` for authorized head/Finance where configured, `.read` by scoped entity/project. Planner cannot approve own plan where segregation applies; sensitive funding lines have field scope.

## 11. Business Rules

`BR-PROC-PLN-001` active plan has approved period/entity scope; `002` plan approval is not budget reservation; `003` material revisions retain prior version and reason; `004` linked PR cannot consume more planned quantity/value than policy permits without exception; `005` actual and commitment metrics come from source modules.

## 12. Data Fields and Ownership

Procurement owns plan ID/version, year/period, entity/department, requirement lines, category, quantity/UOM, expected date/method, estimate/currency, funding/project refs, approval and utilization links. Finance owns budget and funding truth; HRMS/Organization owns department; PR/PO own transaction facts.

## 13. Screens and Data Views

Department plan editor, consolidated calendar, review/approval queue, version comparison, linked PR/PO utilization, period close and variance views. Filters respect entity/department scope.

## 14. User Experience and Human Behaviour

Explain that estimates may change and that plan approval does not authorize buying. Show duplicate-looking requirements for consolidation without forcing unrelated departments to share budget. Highlight unfunded and overdue planned needs.

## 15. Notifications and Communications

Planning window opens, submission/review due, return/approval, forecast date approaching, material variance and period close. Notify assigned owner through permitted channels and links.

## 16. Documents and Attachments

Business case, funding letter, forecast sheet and plan approval evidence are scanned, versioned, scoped and retained. PR links the relevant plan evidence rather than copying uncontrolled files.

## 17. Exceptions and Edge Cases

Financial-year change, multi-year contract, cross-department purchase, partial funding, project cancellation, currency estimate change, late PR outside plan, duplicate plan lines and period close with open transactions.

## 18. Integrations, APIs, Events and Sandbox

Consume Finance period/budget and Organization/Project refs; publish plan approved/revised/closed facts after commit. PR link contract carries plan line/version and tenant/entity; downstream actuals are idempotent projections. Sandbox tests synthetic budget period changes and late actuals.

## 19. Audit, Security and Privacy

Append line changes, consolidation, approval, revision and close with actor/reason; restrict funding and project fields. No rewrite of published plan version; exports logged.

## 20. Reports, Dashboards and Metrics

Forecast by category/month/entity, plan-to-PR conversion, planned versus ordered/actual, late demand, funding gaps and sourcing pipeline. Define currency conversion, as-of time and denominator.

## 21. Configuration and Localization

Financial calendars, planning windows, required line fields, materiality, approval path, carry-forward rules, currency and local date are effective-dated by entity; Finance remains budget owner.

## 22. Non-Functional Requirements

Bulk plan entry/import is validated and idempotent if enabled; consolidation and reporting scale to planned volume. Accessible spreadsheet-like entry and version comparison are required. Targets await estimates.

## 23. Postconditions

Active plan version has approved lines and funding status reference; linked PRs show source plan version; closure preserves open transaction history and variance.

## 24. Failure and Recovery

Finance reference outage leaves funding Unverified; plan may remain reviewable but cannot claim confirmed budget. Failed actual sync retries by source ID/version; inconsistent utilization enters reconciliation queue.

## 25. Acceptance Criteria

Given valid department plan, review and approval create immutable Active version. Given material revision, prior version and delta remain visible. Given linked PR, plan utilization updates without creating a Finance reservation. Given unauthorized department, view/edit is denied.

## 26. Test Scenarios

Test annual submission, consolidation, return/revision, cross-entity access, multi-currency estimate, period rollover, duplicate actual event, project cancellation, budget outage and plan close with open PR.

## 27. Ownership and Dependencies

Procurement planning owner governs forecast; Finance owns budget/period; departments own demand; Organization/Project owners supply refs. Depends on PROC-CFG-01 and PROC-02 integration; sourcing/reporting consume plan.

## 28. Open Decisions and Assumptions

Confirm plan horizon, mandatory categories, consolidation authority, relation to Finance budget, plan-line overrun policy, multi-year handling, import needs and launch timing. Owners: Procurement planning, Finance and departments; resolve before build.
