/**
 * Release scope — the single switch that decides what ships now.
 *
 * This release covers Setup, People, Payroll and Configuration, plus
 * everything payroll actually depends on: a pay run is only as good as the
 * hours, absence and claims that feed it, and the approvals that make those
 * figures final.
 *
 * Everything else is built but deliberately held back and shown as
 * "Coming soon" rather than deleted. Re-enabling an area is a one-line change.
